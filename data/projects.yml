    **An open-source project from Square**

    Squash is a collection of tools that help engineers find and kill bugs in their
    code. Squash consists of the following components:

    * **Client libraries:** Client libraries for different systems (Ruby, Ruby on
      Rails, Cocoa with Objective-C, etc.) catch and record errors when they occur,
      then send them to the API endpoint. Client libraries can be found under the
      [SquareSquash organization](https://github.com/SquareSquash).
    * **Front-end:** This website displays Bug information and helps the engineer
      find the root cause for a Bug, and fix it. It also lets engineers manage,
      assign, and comment on Bugs, as well as view statistics about the Bug.
    * **API endpoints:** These routes (part of the front-end app) receive exception
      notifications from the client libraries and process them.
